Features:
  Import:
    Topbar:
      - Two "tabs", import and database (or something better named)

      - Either keep the data while switching or prompt user that data will be lost
        and then switch if the user accepts.

      - Topbar should always be visible or at least accessable when scrolling.
      This might be triggered with the user moving the mouse to the top of the
      screen if they have scrolled down.

    Sidebar:
      - Doubleclicking on a list item should make it appear in the main body area.
        Maybe also a small add button next to it to avoid double clicking like crazy.

      - When a country has been clicked, close the country list and open the years
        list.

      - If a country has been chosen, the user can click the countries tab again to
        open up the tab and change the country to another country.

      - If user changes country, prompt that all the filters/years chosen will be
        reverted and if the user accepts this, revert all the data in the content pane
        and show the newly chosen country. The prompt should only appear if the user
        have chosen filterdata and not when he/she is changing between countries.

      - Make the sidebar scrollable when needed.

      - Connect the sidebar to the lower levels of the app so that it will only
      show viable options in the DHS API. If a country has no surveys, do not
      show the country at all since there are no data to import.

    Content pane:
      - Make a lane for each for country, years and filters.

      - Make it possible to delete a chosen filter from the content pane.

      - If deleting the country, prompt the user telling him/her that doing this
      will remove all other filters.

      - Removing a country may remove filter options available, find a way to
      handle this in a good way.

      - Add a button in bottom-right called import. Pretty obvious what that
      does.

      - Make the content pane scrollable.

  Database:
    Topbar:
      - Same as importer

    Sidebar:
      - More info coming here.
